Task one :
1. To clean and preprocess the images and save them in some directory in google-drive.
2. To do this I will have to think about some data-pipeline so that I can add the data at any-time possible.
I am thinking of like this:
Create a folder /input-images and dump i.pkl file in this folder and save the corresponding ground truth 
in a train.csv that contains i.pkl, {Ground_Truth}
